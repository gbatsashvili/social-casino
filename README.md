## Features

- **Theming and Customization**: Easily adjust colors, fonts, logos, and layout styles using a theme configuration.
- **Configurable Layout**: Control the style of the sidebar and app bar as well as the visibility of the banner and footer.
- **Customer-Specific Configurations**: Choose from predefined configurations for different customers:
  - **Customer A**: Uses a default theme similar to `customerA` settings.
  - **Customer B**: Features an app bar layout with the footer hidden.
  - **Customer C**: Uses an app bar layout with both the banner and footer hidden.

## URL-Based Theming

To view the app with different customer configurations, simply append the customer identifier to the URL path. The available customer configurations are:

Customer A (default theme): /customerA
Customer B (with app bar layout and hidden footer): /customerB
Customer C (with app bar layout and hidden banner and footer): /customerC
For example:

- To see the theme and layout for Customer A, navigate to:
  http://localhost:3000/customerA

- To see the theme and layout for Customer B, navigate to:
  http://localhost:3000/customerB

- To see the theme and layout for Customer C, navigate to:
  http://localhost:3000/customerC

## Theming and Configuration

The project includes a dynamic theme and layout configuration system. Customer-specific configurations are defined in JSON files, allowing each customer to have a unique look and feel.

## Theme Settings

You can adjust the following in the theme configuration:

- Colors: Set primary, secondary, and background colors.
- Fonts: Configure font families and sizes.
- Logos: Define customer-specific logos.
- Layouts: Configure styles for sidebar, app bar, and overall layout.

## Visibility Options

The project includes toggles for controlling the visibility of various components, including:

- Banner: show or hide

- Footer: show or hide

## Customer Configurations

The app is pre-configured with three sample customers:

- Customer A: Uses the default theme, matching the default configuration.
- Customer B: Has an app bar layout with the footer hidden.
- Customer C: Features an app bar layout with both the banner and footer hidden.

To switch between customer configurations, update the configuration file associated with the customer in /config.

## Customization

Adding a New Customer Configuration: To add a new customer, create a new JSON configuration file with the desired settings and update the theme provider to load the new configuration.
Modifying Theme and Layout: Update the default theme settings in /styles/theme.ts or individual customer JSON files.
